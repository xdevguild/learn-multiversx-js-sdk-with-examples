# MultiversX JavaScript SDK Examples

Welcome to the repository containing code examples for the [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js) of the MultiversX blockchain. This collection of examples demonstrates various SDK features and capabilities to help developers effectively integrate and utilize MultiversX in their projects.

## Overview

This repository is structured to include multiple demonstrations gradually. Each example is organized into its section and will be tagged accordingly to facilitate easy navigation and version control.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the available examples, clone this repository and navigate to the specific section you are interested in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xdevguild/multiversx-js-sdk-examples.git
cd multiversx-js-sdk-examples
```

### Prerequisites

To run the examples, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Current Examples

More examples will be added progressively. Each part/example is associated with a separate git tag. As new examples are added, each tag will include the latest work and retain earlier examples, organized into individual files with descriptive names. This structure allows users to easily understand and trace the development of each example and access previous versions cleanly and efficiently.
 To check out a specific tag, use:

```bash
git checkout <tag_name>
```

## Security and Wallet Information

The examples use a demo wallet with a hardcoded password. All interactions occur on the **devnet** (the development network of MultiversX), ensuring it is safe to expose the wallet credentials. The devnet is designed for testing and development and does not involve real assets.
