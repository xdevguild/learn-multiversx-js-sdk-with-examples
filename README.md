# MultiversX JavaScript SDK Examples

Welcome to the repository containing code examples for the JavaScript SDK of the MultiversX blockchain. This collection of examples demonstrates various features and capabilities of the SDK to help developers effectively integrate and utilize MultiversX in their projects.

## Overview

This repository is structured to gradually include multiple demonstrations. Each example is organized into its own section and will be tagged accordingly to facilitate easy navigation and version control.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the available examples, clone this repository and navigate to the specific section you are interested in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xdevguild/multiversx-js-sdk-examples.git
cd multiversx-js-sdk-examples
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to run the examples. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Current Examples

Currently, the repository hosts three examples. More examples will be added progressively. Each part/example is associated with a separate git tag. As new examples are added, each tag will not only include the new work but will also retain earlier examples, which are organized into separate files with descriptive names. This structure allows users to easily understand and trace the development of each example, as well as access previous versions cleanly and efficiently.
 To check out a specific tag, use:

```bash
git checkout <tag_name>
```

## Security and Wallet Information

The examples use a demo wallet with a hardcoded password. All interactions occur on the **devnet** (development network of MultiversX), ensuring that it is safe to expose the wallet credentials. The devnet is designed for testing and development, involving no real assets. Don't do this on the mainnet.

These examples are provided "as is" without any warranty. They are intended for educational and development purposes only. By using these examples on the mainnet, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.
